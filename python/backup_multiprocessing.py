Backup Script with Multiprocessing
----------------------------------

This script is designed to efficiently back up data from the source directory
(/data/prod) to the destination directory (/data/prod_backup) using the rsync
command. It utilizes the multiprocessing module to parallelize the syncing
tasks, improving performance by leveraging multiple CPU cores.

Modules:
    - os: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
    - subprocess: Allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.
    - multiprocessing: Supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module.

Functions:
    - sync_task: Synchronizes a single source file or directory to the destination using rsync.
    - main: Main function that prepares the list of tasks and distributes them among worker processes for parallel execution.

Usage:
    Run this script with elevated permissions (e.g., sudo) if necessary to
    ensure it has access to the source and destination directories:
    
    $ sudo ./backup_script.py

Description:
sync_task Function:

This function synchronizes a single file or directory from the source to the destination using the rsync command.

It takes a task tuple as an argument, which contains the source path and the destination path.

main Function:

Defines the source (src) and destination (dest) directories.

Creates the destination directory if it doesnâ€™t already exist.

Uses os.walk() to traverse the source directory and create a list of tasks. Each task is a tuple representing the source and destination paths.

Utilizes the multiprocessing.Pool class to create a pool of worker processes, distributing the tasks among the available CPU cores for parallel execution.
